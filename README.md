# SailTrade

A painterly, top-down sailing prototype built with React and Vite. Glide across a procedurally generated archipelago, experiment with smooth sailing physics, and explore the look and feel for the upcoming trading adventure.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the local development URL shown in the terminal.

## Controls

- **W / ↑** – accelerate forward
- **S / ↓** – reef sails and slow your speed
- **A / ←** – turn port
- **D / →** – turn starboard

The world is generated freshly on every refresh, so feel free to restart whenever you want a new cluster of islands.
